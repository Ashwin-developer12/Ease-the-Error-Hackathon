# HACKATHON DOMAIN: 
MACHINE LEARNING

# PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Create a machine learning model that
can analyze customer behavior and predict their likelihood to
purchase a product or service

# ABSTRACT:
In order to implement a more efficient ML
model to be used for non-linear
mappings, complex relationships and
scalable outputs based on customer behaviour we use NEURAL
NETWORKS with a total of 6 layers
including the input and output layers.
The model is deployed into web page using Flask.
